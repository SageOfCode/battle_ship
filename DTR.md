Template for DTR Memo
Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Sage Gonzales, Shaun James

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
* Learn from the project and embrace our mistakes and take notes from them. Get used to the git workflow and become better acquainted with one another. If we are more comfortable with the git workflow that shows we are learning the process.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
* Great teammate, willing to participate and learn. Creative.
* Driver/navigator

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
* Great communication will aid in discovering solutions for issues that arise.
* Willingness to reach out and break out of unproductive struggle.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
* Driver/navigator
* Weekends, Mornings, and early evenings are the best time to work together on the project.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
* SLACK!
* Zoom
* Tuple
* Teletype

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Improving upon ruby syntax and TDD. Better familiarization with Ruby basics. Also gain a better understanding of git workflow.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* We have the idea that we both will work on the project together. Sage will drive for iteration I while Shaun navigates. Then Shaun will drive for iteration II while Sage navigates. For iteration III we will both take turns driving.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
* Sage will make the repo and invite Shaun to it. We will work on branches that represents the feature we are implementing then push to Github. We will both review any pull request to make sure the code is representative of our team's thought process.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
* We will try to abide by a timer. It will be set to about every 25-30 minutes.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Keep the feedback kind, actionable, and honest. Feedback won't be taken personally.

Additional Remote Considerations:
* Shaun has kids and appreciates a 6PM dinner break and understanding when they are not quiet.
* Sage is an early riser and would like to perform work in the morning, rather than late at night.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
* GitHub projects
* potentially Trello

Day 1 Agenda:
* Make the repo, add collaborators, and add the DTR to it.
* Make a flowchart or organize our thought process on how to create the game.
